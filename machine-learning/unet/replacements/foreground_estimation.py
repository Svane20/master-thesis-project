    # IMPORTANT: In our training data, the alpha matte is generated so that the sky/HDRI (our target subject)
    # is marked as 1 and the foreground/geometry is 0. However, the pymatting.estimate_foreground_ml function
    # is designed to extract the "foreground" (the object of interest) as the opaque region (alpha = 1).
    #
    # In our sky replacement pipeline, we want to preserve the geometry (foreground) from the original image
    # and replace the sky (background) with a new sky. To achieve this using pymatting, we need to extract
    # the geometry as the foreground. Therefore, we invert the alpha mask (using 1 - alpha_mask) so that:
    #    - The original geometry (which was 0) becomes 1 (treated as the foreground),
    #    - The sky (which was 1) becomes 0 (treated as background).

    # This inversion aligns the alpha mask with pymattingâ€™s expectation for foreground extraction.
